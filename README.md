Tin Can Verbs
=============

An open source index of Tin Can API/Experience API verb information. Browse the data at http://fugu13.github.io/tin-can-verbs/

Contributions welcome. If you're looking to be a regular contributor, the suggested approach is to clone the
repository here on github, check it out locally, add a verb file (don't forget to put it in the verb file list),
and issue a pull request.

For occasional contributions, I accept them via email at russell.duhon@saltbox.com . Please include information
on where you use the verb, and keep your description concise, readable, and useful. I will include just about
any verb in actual use, but I reserve the right to edit descriptions for those properties in this repository. I
encourage anyone who wants to maintain their own verb lists to do so (perhaps starting by forking this repository).
